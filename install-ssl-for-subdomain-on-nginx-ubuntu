Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.

Congratulations! You have successfully enabled https://yourdomain.com
4. Automatic renewal
You can also create a cron job in order to set up an automatic SSL renewal. To do this first run:

crontab -e
and then add the following:

0 0 1 * * /usr/bin/letsencrypt renew >> /var/log/letsencrypt-renew.log
Save the file and close it. Restart the cron service so the changes can take effect:

service cron restart
That’s it. You can now open https://yourdomain.com in your browser and verify whether the Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate has been installed properly.
